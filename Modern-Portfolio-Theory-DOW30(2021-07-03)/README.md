# Modern Portfolio Theory — (MPT); DOW30

Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk. Harry Markowitz pioneered this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was published in the Journal of Finance in 1952. He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory.

Modern portfolio theory argues that an investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone, but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk. Likewise, given a desired level of expected return, an investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk. Based on statistical measures such as variance and correlation, an individual investment's performance is less important than how it impacts the entire portfolio.

MPT assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. As a practical matter, risk aversion implies that most people should invest in multiple asset classes.

Portfolio Expected Return
--------------------------------
The expected return of a portfolio is calculated by multiplying the weight of the asset by its return and summing the values of all the assets together. To introduce a forward looking estimate, probability may be introduced to generate and incorporate features in business and economy.

Portfolio Expected Variance
--------------------------------
Portfolio variance is used as the measure of risk in this model. A higher variance will indicate a higher risk for the asset class and the portfolio.

Sharpe Ratio
--------------------------------
The Sharpe ratio measures the return of an investment in relation to the risk-free rate (Treasury rate) and its risk profile.
